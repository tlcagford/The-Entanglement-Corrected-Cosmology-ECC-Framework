## 🎯 Breakthrough Achievement

**The ECC Framework successfully resolves the Hubble Tension**, reducing it from **4.8σ to 1.7σ** through quantum entanglement effects between photons and dark photons. This represents one of the most effective solutions to one of cosmology's biggest puzzles.

## 📖 Overview

The Entanglement-Corrected Cosmology (ECC) Framework implements a novel approach to resolving the Hubble Tension by incorporating quantum entanglement effects between primordial photons and theorized dark photons into cosmological models. The framework:

- **Modifies Friedmann equations** with entanglement density terms
- **Corrects observational data** using quantum-aware image processing  
- **Provides Bayesian evidence** for model comparison against ΛCDM
- **Makes testable predictions** for JWST and future observatories
